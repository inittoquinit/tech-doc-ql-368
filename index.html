            Allomancy is the art of ingesting certain metals and ‘burning’ them to activate a certain power. It is rare gift, found in only around one in everything thousand citizen of Scadrial.
          </p>

          <p>
            Listed here is a comprehensive guide to Allomancers, covering all sixteen metals and their abilities, as well as a description of how they can work together.

          <p>An Allomancer is a general term used to describe anyone that can burn a metal. There are two main categories: Mistings and Mistborn. Mistings are much more common, but can only burn one metal. Because of that, many spend their whole lives mastering the use of that metal, becoming experts at the intricacies of their abilities.</p>
          
          <p>Mistborn, on the other hand, are incredibly rare, but are capable of burning all sixteen metals. This makes them extraordinarily powerful, one-person armies that can rip through opponents with devastating efficiency. That said, because they have to learn how to use all metals, they are often less technically talented than Misting counterparts, though they certainly make up for it in raw power.</p>

            There are sixteen basic Allomantic metals. The metals come in pairs: one periodic element, and its alloy. These pairs have complementary effects. Similarly, each elemental metal is classified as a "Pulling" ability, whereas each alloy is classified as a "Pushing" ability.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to Pulling and Pushing classifications, there are external and internal metals. External powers influence things outside an Allomancer's body, while internal powers influence the Allomancer. This naturally divides the sixteen Allomantic metals into four groups of four metals each: physical, mental, temporal, and enhancement powers.

            function push {
     if (user.isCoinshot && weight>.target) {
         return target.pushed();

         push .coinshot

          </code>

          <p>
            Steel Pushing and iron Pulling are incredibly versatile talents, both for coinshots and lurchers and Mistborn. How it works is quite simple - when an Allomancer burns either steel or iron, they see faint blue lines connecting them to nearby sources of metal. If they focus on those lines, they can Push or Pull on that metal, moving it closer to them or away from their center of gravity. If the metal is heavier than them, or obstructed in some way, they will be moves towards or away from it instead. More than one Allomancer can Push or Pull the same object at the same time. They can only push with their own weight, so if, for example, two Allomancers were to both Push on a coin with their full weight, the heavier one would stay in place and the lighter one would be Pushed back.
          </p>

          <p>
            Steel Pushing and iron Pulling are a Mistborn’s main method of both attacking and transportation. Pushing off of nearby sources of metal, they can fling themselves into the air, then Pull on nearby building fixtures or drop coins to Push off of to propel themselves in the desired direction. A talented Mistborn can cover fast distances in minutes, and can even use these abilities in combat to dodge attacks or reposition themselves rapidly and disorient their opponent. Though it is technically possible for coinshots and lurchers to achieve a similar effect, their movement would be much more limited, and flinging themselves into the air would be much more risky as they cannot strengthen their body like Mistborn can to protect against hard landings.
          </p>
          
					<p>
						Offensively, Pushing and Pulling is often used to attack by throwing a handful of coins towards their opponent and Pushing them to create a hailstorm of projectiles (hence the nickname for steel Mistings, coinshot). They can also Push and Pull on any opponent wearing or carrying metal, incapacitating anyone wearing armor (or even metal fixtures like belt buckles) and disarming anyone carrying a metal weapon. For that reason, Mistborn often avoid carrying any metal they’re not likely to either eat or throw, and use glass daggers in lieu of metal weaponry that could be used against them.

          <p>
            Soothing and Rioting emotions is a difficult talent to master, though it is often underestimated. Soothers (Mistings who burn brass) can calm the emotions of nearby people. With practice, they can target specific emotions and dampen them. Any emotion can be targeted - a Soother could make an angry person calm, or a confident person doubtful. Rioting works similarly, but in the opposite direction. Rioters (Mistings who burn zinc) can inflame the emotions of nearby people, and can target specific emotions to, say, make a calm person angry or a doubtful person confident. Talented Soothers and Rioters can target emotions with surgical precision, subtly changing a person’s feelings without them even realizing it. That said, they cannot target emotions that the person was not already feeling - they can’t make a joyful person angry, for example.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mistborn take this one step forward, as they can both Riot and Soothe emotions. With concentration, they can Soothe most of a person’s emotions, dampening them, while simultaneously Rioting the emotion they want them to feel. This is incredibly useful, allowing them to make people trust them more easily or make opponents fearful of them. Their ability to burn Copper also means they can’t be manipulated themselves, but conversely, also can’t manipulate other Mistborn (or Smokers, for that matter).
